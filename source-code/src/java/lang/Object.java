     * <ul>
     * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during

     *     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     *     used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     *     在一个Java应用中，不管是你调用一次还是多次调用hashCode方法，此方法必须返回同一个hashCode,不能改变。
     *     当在不同的Java应用时(不同的JVM进程)，可以不相同。
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     *     如果两个对象调用equals方法返回true,那么这两个对象hashCode值一定相同。
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
     *     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
     *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
     *     两个不同对象(equals为false)产生的hash值不一定要求不能相等。可以有冲突相等。
     *     然后，开发者应该注意为了提高hash tables的性能，不同的对象产生的hashCode尽量不相等。
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
     * class {@code Object} does return distinct integers for distinct
     * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
     * address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
     * technique is not required by the
     * Java&trade; programming language.)
     * 为了保证此方法尽可能的合理实现，hashCode通常通过Object对象来实现。最典型的实现就是将对象的内部地址转换为整数返回。
     * 但是这个实现在Java语言中没有做强制要求。

     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a

     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an

     * Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the

     * In other words, this method behaves exactly as if it simply
     * performs the call {@code wait(0)}.
     * <p>
     * The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread
     * releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread
     * notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up
     * either through a call to the {@code notify} method or the
     * {@code notifyAll} method. The thread then waits until it can
     * re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution.
     * <p>
     * As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
     * possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
     * <pre>
     *     synchronized (obj) {
     *         while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
     *             obj.wait();
     *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.
     * 线程进入等待状态直接其实线程调用对象的{@link java.lang.Object#notify()}或者
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()}方法。换句话说，这个方法与{@code wait(0)}方法的表现行为
     * 完全一样。
     * 这个方法通常配合锁使用，只有获取了锁的对象才能调用wait方法，释放当前对象所并且进入等待状态。直到
     * 有线程通过 {@code notify}或者 {@code notifyAll}方法来唤醒当前线程。被唤醒之后，当前对象没有特权，需要
     * 和其它对象一样争抢对象锁。
     * 由于此方法可能被中断，摆出异常。所以通过与while配合使用。通过while循环来控制尝试多次获取锁。
     * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of the object's monitor.
     * @throws  InterruptedException if any thread interrupted the
     *             current thread before or while the current thread

     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java&trade; virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
     * 方法 {@code finalize} 是被GC收集在判断没有引用指向当前对象执行的方法。
     * 一个子类重写此方法去处理系统资源或者执行其它清理操作。
     * 一般约定，当JVM判断没有任何活动的线程的可以到达这个对象可，方法 {@code finalize}就会被调用。
     * 方法 {@code finalize}可以做任何事情 ，包括将将对象重新关联到活着的Thread上。通常最常见的目的是
     * 在对象被回收之前进行清理操作。比如，可以在对象被清理之前，关闭打开了的I/O相关的操作。
     * 当在{@code finalize}方法被调用之后，就不会有其它实质性的操作。对象是否回收，需要JVM再次判断对象有没有重新关联到
     * 活动的线程或者可用对象，再做最终决定是否要清除对象。
     * {@code finalize}永远只会调用一次，不会调用多次。
     *
