/**
 * A stage(阶段/步骤) of a possibly asynchronous computation, that performs an
 * action or computes a value when another CompletionStage completes.
 * 异步计算的一个阶段，它在另一个CompletionStage完成时执行一个动作或计算一个值。
 * 即实现了不同异步计算的组合，比如then ,after,and等不同关系。
 * A stage completes upon termination of its computation, but this may
 * in turn trigger other dependent stages.  The functionality defined
 * in this interface takes only a few basic forms, which expand out to
 * a larger set of methods to capture a range of usage styles: <ul>
 * 一个阶段在其计算结束时完成，但这可能反过来触发其他相关阶段。
 * <li>The computation performed by a stage may be expressed as a
 * Function, Consumer, or Runnable (using methods with names including
 * <em>apply</em>, <em>accept</em>, or <em>run</em>, respectively)
 * depending on whether it requires arguments and/or produces results.
 * For example, {@code stage.thenApply(x -> square(x)).thenAccept(x ->
 * System.out.print(x)).thenRun(() -> System.out.println())}. An
 * additional form (<em>compose</em>) applies functions of stages
 * themselves, rather than their results. </li>
 *
 * <li> One stage's execution may be triggered by completion of a
 * single stage, or both of two stages, or either of two stages.
 * Dependencies on a single stage are arranged using methods with
 * prefix <em>then</em>. Those triggered by completion of
 * <em>both</em> of two stages may <em>combine</em> their results or
 * effects, using correspondingly named methods. Those triggered by
 * <em>either</em> of two stages make no guarantees about which of the
 * results or effects are used for the dependent stage's
 * computation.</li>
 *
 * <li> Dependencies among stages control the triggering of
 * computations, but do not otherwise guarantee any particular
 * ordering. Additionally, execution of a new stage's computations may
 * be arranged in any of three ways: default execution, default
 * asynchronous execution (using methods with suffix <em>async</em>
 * that employ the stage's default asynchronous execution facility),
 * or custom (via a supplied {@link Executor}).  The execution
 * properties of default and async modes are specified by
 * CompletionStage implementations, not this interface. Methods with
 * explicit Executor arguments may have arbitrary execution
 * properties, and might not even support concurrent execution, but
 * are arranged for processing in a way that accommodates asynchrony.
 *
 * <li> Two method forms support processing whether the triggering
 * stage completed normally or exceptionally: Method {@link
 * #whenComplete whenComplete} allows injection of an action
 * regardless of outcome, otherwise preserving the outcome in its
 * completion. Method {@link #handle handle} additionally allows the
 * stage to compute a replacement result that may enable further
 * processing by other dependent stages.  In all other cases, if a
 * stage's computation terminates abruptly with an (unchecked)
 * exception or error, then all dependent stages requiring its
 * completion complete exceptionally as well, with a {@link
 * CompletionException} holding the exception as its cause.  If a
 * stage is dependent on <em>both</em> of two stages, and both
 * complete exceptionally, then the CompletionException may correspond
 * to either one of these exceptions.  If a stage is dependent on
 * <em>either</em> of two others, and only one of them completes
 * exceptionally, no guarantees are made about whether the dependent
 * stage completes normally or exceptionally. In the case of method
 * {@code whenComplete}, when the supplied action itself encounters an
 * exception, then the stage exceptionally completes with this
 * exception if not already completed exceptionally.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All methods adhere to the above triggering, execution, and
 * exceptional completion specifications (which are not repeated in
 * individual method specifications). Additionally, while arguments
 * used to pass a completion result (that is, for parameters of type
 * {@code T}) for methods accepting them may be null, passing a null
 * value for any other parameter will result in a {@link
 * NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <p>This interface does not define methods for initially creating,
 * forcibly completing normally or exceptionally, probing completion
 * status or results, or awaiting completion of a stage.
 * Implementations of CompletionStage may provide means of achieving
 * such effects, as appropriate.  Method {@link #toCompletableFuture}
 * enables interoperability among different implementations of this
 * interface by providing a common conversion type.

 *
 * 一、Future接口可以构建异步应用，但依然有其局限性。它很难直接表述多个Future 结果之间的依赖性。
 *     而总的来说，接口CompletableFuture定义了可与其他Future组合成异步计算契约，把Java 5引入的Future的缺点都给完善了。
 * 二、例如以下场景，Future很难完成：
 *      1、将两个异步计算合并为一个——这两个异步计算之间相互独立，同时第二个又依赖于第一个的结果。
 *      2、等待 Future 集合中的所有任务都完成。
 *      3、仅等待 Future集合中最快结束的任务完成（有可能因为它们试图通过不同的方式计算同一个值），并返回它的结果。
 *      4、通过编程方式完成一个Future任务的执行（即以手工设定异步操作结果的方式）。
 *      应对 Future 的完成事件（即当 Future 的完成事件发生时会收到通知，并能使用 Future 计算的结果进行下一步的操作，
 *      不只是简单地阻塞等待操作的结果）
 * 三、总之，新的CompletableFuture类将使得这些成为可能。
